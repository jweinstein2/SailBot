Hi EE,

Here are a list of ideas that we would love for you to implement on the final cape.
As software people, we probably will be playing a lot with your creations and don't
want to break anything.

- Please spec EVERYTHING in a digital form (ideally doc or text file).  We want to put
this on the github so that software people can reference it.  Talk to someone on the team 
if you don't know git and they will help you.

- Please make plugs that only plug in one way.  If we can put the plug in backwards, we will.
And sometimes that causes problems.

- Please DO NOT assume we know/are capable of tracing wires on the cape or even really reading
anything on the cape that you have not labeled.  Also, any connection that may ever require
a multimeter to double-check how to connect things is way too hard for us.

- Wire color conventions would be useful if they were religiously followed but not if they
are only sporadically followed.  Please document conventions in the spec for us.

CAPE NEEDS: from the software side, it would be great to have clear, idiot-proof connections
for:
All three servos
Power
The manual channel coming from the RC receiver
The 3 servo channels coming from the RC receiver (THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT ERIC TOLD MATT)
The Airmar
The Vectornav
The Router
etc
