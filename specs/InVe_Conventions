InVeConventions.txt					Eric Anderson Mar 2015

Because we will have multiple people working on our codebase, it makes sense to
adopt a standard convention for things, ESPECIALLY as it relates to ROS.  This can change after discussion- it is just a jumping off point based on what we've done so far.

ROS Message Files stored in /msg directories;  capitalize first letter of all words.
  - example: MyMessageSignature.msg

ROS topics: all lower case separated by underscores
  - example: tactics_message

ROS Subscriber callback functions: name should end with ..._callback.
 - example: airmar_callback
