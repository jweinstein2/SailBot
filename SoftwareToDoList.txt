(This file is meant to serve as an updatable list of open projects
for InVe's software team.  Feel free to update as appropriate)

On a ROS computer, use catkin on tactics directory to correctly configure for ros

Write documentation for gpsCalc.py

Write Airmar driver node to publish to airmar.msg

Finish High Level ROS nodes as spec'ed in Inve_Arch_Specs.txt
  Captain:  Needs fleshing out for leg sequencing, various competition modes 
  Navigator: Almost done- Andrew
  Tactics: Completed- Eric
  SpeedStats: Almost done- Andrew
  Helm: Waiting for Ratchet to be built
  Trim: " " " "

Research wireless router options and how they interface with beaglebone -- DONE ALEX 3/20 (See https://docs.google.com/a/yale.edu/spreadsheets/d/1beB5BEvLkQJY4xXFddYkIvXsUNpozM_eqoJODXWJMUA/edit#gid=0)

Write Ratchet Servo Driver Node (for all three servos on board- main,jib,rudder)

Implement/Research "Snapshot" functionality where, when sailing under RC control, we
can capture all data and servo positions (that way we can manually tune and remember
good setups with balanced helm)

Test all high level software by walking around with BBB/Laptop and having it lead us around.

Per Alex's suggestion: Hook up high level nodes to Armstrong and have Armstrong drive a
course?

Add a function gpsVectorAdd(lat,lon,bearing,distance) to the gpsCalc.py library
which takes a gps position (lat and lon) and adds to it a vector specified by compass position (bearing) and distance (distance).  Returns a (lat,lon) pair of the resulting position.  With this function, we should be able to calculate the gps location of a point x meters to the north/south/etc of a given point.   COMPLETED ERIC 3/20

Write guidelines for EE cape- DONE BY ERIC 3/20

Factor GPS code into single python file and import it inn apropriate places- DONE BY ERIC 3/20
